## Reference-First Coding Experience

Today I coded with documentation open and:

- Felt okay about it but i Still felt guilty but i know that it's okay and even experienced programmers always look up codes.

## Breakthrough Moments

Had no breakthroughs today just confusion but i am happy that i am starting to understand the codes.

## Still Confused About

Today's confusion had to do with applying chain rule to finance and also i am a bit sad that some simple formulas aren't stuck in my head.

## Tomorrow's Goals
