# Day 5: Integration & Wealth Accumulation

Not done = Still debugging since i am learning with templates given by ai

## What I Built

### 1. Integration Visualizer

- Visualizes integration as area under curve
- Shows Riemann sum approximation
- Demonstrates convergence

### 2. Numerical Integration Toolkit

- Multiple methods: Riemann, Trapezoidal, Simpson's
- Error analysis and convergence testing
- Verified against known solutions

### 3. Wealth Accumulation System

- Discrete vs continuous compounding
- Applied to real market data
- Portfolio tracking with metrics

### 4. Complete Portfolio Wealth Tracker (Capstone)

- Multi-stock portfolio tracking
- Wealth visualization over time
- Performance metrics (Sharpe, drawdown, etc.)---not done
- 4-year university plan simulation --- not done
- Billionaire timeline calculator---not done

## Key Concepts Mastered

### Mathematics

- Integration as area under curve
- Integration as antiderivative
- Numerical integration methods
- Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

### Finance Applications

- Daily returns = derivative of wealth
- Cumulative wealth = integral of returns
- Discrete vs continuous compounding
- Long-term wealth projection

## The Big Insight

**Returns and Wealth are connected by calculus:**

- Returns (rate of change) ←→ Wealth (accumulation)
- Derivative ←→ Integral
- This is the Fundamental Theorem in action

## Files

- `integration_visualization.py` - Visual understanding
- `numerical_integration.py` - Integration methods
- `wealth_accumulator.py` - Compounding calculator
- `portfolio_wealth_tracker.py` - Complete system (not fully functional but will work on it)

Day 5: Integration & wealth accumulation - Complete portfolio tracker

- Built integration visualizer (area under curve, Riemann sums)
- Implemented numerical integration methods (Riemann, Trapezoidal, Simpson's)
- Created wealth accumulation system (discrete vs continuous)
- Complete portfolio wealth tracker with performance metrics ---tried to
- 4-year university plan simulator----tried to
- Billionaire timeline calculator----tried to

Integration concepts now clear: returns = derivative, wealth = integral
