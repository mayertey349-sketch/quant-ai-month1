# Day 5: Integration & Wealth Accumulation

## What I Built

### 1. Integration Visualizer

- Visualizes integration as area under curve
- Shows Riemann sum approximation
- Demonstrates convergence

### 2. Numerical Integration Toolkit

- Multiple methods: Riemann, Trapezoidal, Simpson's
- Error analysis and convergence testing
- Verified against known solutions

### 3. Wealth Accumulation System

- Discrete vs continuous compounding
- Applied to real market data(tried to , there are still problems)

## Key Concepts Mastered

### Mathematics

- Integration as area under curve
- Integration as antiderivative
- Numerical integration methods
- Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

### Finance Applications

- Daily returns = derivative of wealth
- Cumulative wealth = integral of returns
- Discrete vs continuous compounding
- Long-term wealth projection

## The Big Insight

**Returns and Wealth are connected by calculus:**

- Returns (rate of change) ←→ Wealth (accumulation)
- Derivative ←→ Integral
- This is the Fundamental Theorem in action

## Files

- `integration_visualization.py` - Visual understanding
- `numerical_integration.py` - Integration methods
- `wealth_accumulator.py` - Compounding calculator

Note:

It took me two days to do this because i was exuasted trying to understand all of integration but i realize that i need not know everything and only need some.
