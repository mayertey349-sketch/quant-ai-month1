# Calculus Applied to Markets - My Understanding

## Before Today

I understood derivatives as formulas but didn't really "get" what they meant.

## After Visualization

Now I see that:

- Derivative = slope of tangent line = rate of change
- On a price chart, returns ARE the derivative
- When derivative > 0, price is rising
- When derivative = 0, price is at a peak/valley
- When derivative < 0, price is falling

## Breakthrough Moment

It clicked when i saw the graphs and started thinking of the prices as the functions and the returns as the slope.

## Connection to Quant Finance

- Finding max derivative = finding days with biggest moves
- Second derivative = detecting acceleration/deceleration
- This is how algorithms detect momentum changes

## What I Still Want to Understand Better

i still want to get used to seeing the prices as functions and returns as their derivatives and also the python language.

## How I'll Use This

I will add this to my startegies that i make in the future.
