# Calculus Applied to Markets - My Understanding

## Before Today

I understood derivatives as formulas but didn't really "get" what they meant.

## After Visualization

Now I see that:

- Derivative = slope of tangent line = rate of change
- On a price chart, returns ARE the derivative
- When derivative > 0, price is rising
- When derivative = 0, price is at a peak/valley
- When derivative < 0, price is falling

## Breakthrough Moment

It clicked when i saw the graphs and started thinking of the prices as the functions and the returns as the slope.

## Connection to Quant Finance

- Finding max derivative = finding days with biggest moves
- Second derivative = detecting acceleration/deceleration
- This is how algorithms detect momentum changes

## What I Still Want to Understand Better

i still want to get used to seeing the prices as functions and returns as their derivatives and also the python language.

## How I'll Use This

I will add this to my startegies that i make in the future.

# My Learning Philosophy (Updated Day 3)

## What I Learned About Learning

### Old Belief (Wrong)
- I need to memorize everything
- Googling syntax means I'm not really learning
- I should be able to code from memory by now
- Going faster = learning better

### New Belief (Correct)
- Understanding concepts > memorizing syntax
- Googling is what professionals do daily
- References are tools, not crutches
- Going deeper = learning better

## How I'll Code From Now On

1. Look up examples first
2. Understand before copying
3. Modify for my needs
4. Verify it works
5. Explain in comments

## How I'll Measure Progress

NOT by:
- ❌ Can I code without Googling?
- ❌ How fast did I finish the material?
- ❌ Do I know everything?

BUT by:
- ✅ Do I understand the concepts?
- ✅ Can I apply them to new problems?
- ✅ Am I building on previous days?
- ✅ Is my code working?

## Commitment to Myself

I commit to:
- Learning deeply, not quickly
- Using references without shame
- Comparing myself to yesterday-me, not imaginary-perfect-me
- Trusting the 3-year process
