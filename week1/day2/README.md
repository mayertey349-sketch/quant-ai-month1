# Day 2 - 17/12/2025

**Time Invested:** 4 hours

**What I Learned:**

- Calculus intuition (derivatives as slopes/rates)
- Power rule and applications to finance
- NumPy array operations
- Portfolio return calculations

**Challenges:**

- Initial calculus confusion (fixed through slower pacing)
- Started late (2 PM) due to internet issues

**Breakthrough Moment:**

- Coding derivatives made the math concept click
- Seeing returns as array operations vs loops

**Tomorrow's Focus:**

- Matplotlib visualization
- More calculus practice
- Chain rule introduction
