**Start Date:** [16/12/2025]  
**Goal:** Build mathematical and programming foundations for breakthrough quantitative AI

From high school math to breakthrough quant AI. Learning Python, mathematics, finance, and ML through disciplined daily practice. Month 1: Foundations. 4+ hours/day. Every commit matters.

## 🎯 Month 1 Objectives

### Python Skills
- [ ] Master Object-Oriented Programming
- [ ] NumPy array operations
- [ ] Pandas data manipulation
- [ ] Matplotlib visualization
- [ ] Financial data analysis

### Math Skills
- [ ] Calculus (derivatives, integrals, optimization)
- [ ] Linear algebra basics
- [ ] Probability theory fundamentals
- [ ] Basic statistics

### Finance Knowledge
- [ ] Stock returns and volatility
- [ ] Portfolio construction
- [ ] Risk-return tradeoff
- [ ] Options basics

## Major Update - December 2024

🎓 **Accepted to KNUST Aerospace Engineering Program**

This changes the timeline but strengthens the foundation:
- University provides: Advanced math, physics, computational methods
- Self-study provides: Quant-specific applications, trading systems
- Combined approach: Best of both worlds

**Adjusted plan:**
- **During university:** 2 hours/day quant self-study (sustainable)
- **Summers:** Intensive quant projects + internships(If any)
- **Goal:** Aerospace engineering degree + quant AI portfolio
- **Timeline:** 4 years instead of 3, but much stronger foundation

The journey continues. Just better resourced now.
